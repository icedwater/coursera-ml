# More Octave/MATLAB resources

MATLAB Youtube links will be added later. Please use the [course page][res] for
now.

## Octave Resources

At the Octave command line, typing `help` followed by a function name displays
documentation for a built-in function. For example, `help plot` will bring up
help information for plotting. Further documentation can be found at the Octave
[documentation pages][oct].

## MATLAB Resources

At the MATLAB command line, typing `help` followed by a function name displays
documentation for a built-in function. For example, `help plot` will bring up
help information for plotting. Further documentation can be found at the MATLAB
[documentation pages][mat].

MathWorks also has a series of videos about various MATLAB features:

### Introduction to MATLAB

| **Learning Module**    | **Learning Goals**
|------------------------|---------------------
| What is MATLAB?        | Introduce MATLAB
| The MATLAB Environment | Navigate the command line, workspace, directory, and
|                        | editor
| MATLAB Variables       | Use the assignment operator to define scalar variables
| MATLAB as a Calculator | Perform arithmetic calculations with scalars and
|                        | functions using MATLAB syntax and order of operations.
| Mathematical Functions | Use MATLAB variables for input and output to
|                        | functions. Examples include: COS, SIN, EXP, and
|                        | NTHROOT.

|                                    | between row and column vectors
| Creating Uniformly Spaced Vectors  | Use the colon operator syntax to create
| (The Colon Operator)               | vectors given the starting and ending
|                                    | values and the size of the interval

|                                | error messages related to incompatible
|                                | dimensions.

### Programming

| **Learning Module**        | **Learning Goals**
|----------------------------|---------------------
| Using the MATLAB Editor    | Write a script in the MATLAB Editor, break code
|                            | into sections to execute, and find help on
