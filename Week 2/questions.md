When there are `n` features, we define the cost function as

    J(theta) = 1/2m sum (i=1, m, (h_theta(x^i) - y(i))^2).

For linear regression, which of the following are also equivalent and correct
definitions of `J(theta)`?

  a.  J(θ) := θj−α1m∑i=1m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))⋅x(i)j
  b.  J(θ) := θj−α1m∑i=1m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))⋅x(i)j
  c.  J(θ) := θj−α1m∑i=1m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))⋅x(i)j
  d.  J(θ) := θj−α1m∑i=1m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))⋅x(i)j
